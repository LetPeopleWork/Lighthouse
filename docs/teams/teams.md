# Gain an Overview

You can see which teams are defined, how many Features they are contributing to (based on the the features in all defined projects), how many work items they working on in total and how many items were already closed.

![Team Deletion](../assets/features/teams_delete.png)

{: .important}
Deleting a team will remove it from Lighthouse with no functionality to undo this change. This will also remove the team from all the involved projects. Ideally you make sure that this team is not involved in any projects before you delete it.

{: .note}
You can always add a team again using the same queries. Deleting a team has no effect at all on the data in your Work Tracking System.

# Constraints in the Free Version
If you are using the free version, you are restricted to three Teams on a single Lighthouse instance.


{: .important}
If you have more than the allowed number, Lighthouse will prevent any updates to all teams until you are not above the maximum number.
