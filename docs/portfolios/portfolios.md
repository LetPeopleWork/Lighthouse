Portfolios are an essential building block for using Lighthouse. You can use Portfolios to keep track of when a set of Features that one or more teams are working on will be done. You can do the following things from this page:

- TOC
{:toc}

![Portfolio Overview](../assets/features/overview.png)

# Gain an Overview
The overview, as the name suggests, shows you a rough overview over all the portfolios. You can see which portfolios are defined, and how many Features are defined as part of this portfolio.

# Create a new Portfolio
If you want to create a new portfolio, click on the *Add New* button on top. That will bring you to the [Portfolio Creation Page](./edit.html).

# Navigate to the Portfolio Details
If you want to see more details for a specific portfolio, either click on the ℹ️ icon on the right side of the portfolio or the portfolio name to navigate to the [Portfolio Details](./detail.html).

# Modify an existing Portfolio
If you want to modify the settings of an existing portfolio, click on the 🖊️ icon on the right side of the portfolio. This will bring you to the [Portfolio Modification Page](./edit.html).

# Delete a Portfolio
If you want to delete a portfolio, you can click on the 🗑️ icon on the right side of the portfolio. This will permantenly delete this portfolio.

{: .important}
Deleting a portfolio will remove it from Lighthouse with no functionality to undo this change. This will not remove any of the involved teams in this portfolio though.

{: .note}
You can always add a portfolio again using the same queries. Deleting a portfolio has no effect at all on the data in your Work Tracking System.


# Constraints in the Free Version
If you are using the free version, you are restricted to one Portfolio on a single Lighthouse instance.

{: .important}
If you have more than the allowed number, Lighthouse will prevent any updates to all portfolios until you are not above the maximum number.
