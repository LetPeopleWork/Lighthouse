This section will provide details on the various features of Lighthouse. In the [Overview](./overview/overview.html), you will see all your projects, and can see their progress and which teams are involved.

In the [Teams](./teams/teams.html) section, you can inspect, create, and modify teams. As part of the [Team Details](./teams/detail.html) you can also run manual *How Many* and *When* [forecasts](../concepts/montecarlosimulations.html).

For all your defined [Projects] the forecasts will continuously be re-run, so you have an up to date information *When* each [Feature](../concepts/concepts.html) of a Project will be done.

For teams as well as projects Lighthouse is collecting data, which is visualized in form of various [Metrics](./metrics/metrics.html).

In the [Settings](./settings/settings.html) you can fine-tune Lighthouse.
