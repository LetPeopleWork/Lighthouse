# Metrics Dashboard
Lighthouse shows all [Widgets](./widgets.html) in a Dashboard.

The dashboard allows you to customize the look and feel based on your needs.

{: .note}
The custom configuration is stored for each team and project, and works "per browser". So if you open it on a different browser, you will have the default design.


# Filtering
You can filter for a time range of your choice when you look at metrics. By default, you'll see the last 30 days (for teams) or last 90 days (for projects). Just change start and/or end date via the date pickers, and Lighthouse will update most metrics. Some [widgets](./widgets.html) are not affected by the time filter.

## Edit Mode
In order to adjust the Dashboard, you have to put it into Edit Mode. This is visible in the Header on the right side as a *pen* icon. Once you are in Edit mode, you can adjust the widgets.

The configuration is applied immediately, you do not need to save.

In order to leave the edit mode, you can either click the edit mode icon again (a green checkbox) or simply click anywhere outside the dashboard.

## Hide Widgets
You can hide any widget. If you do that, they will not be shown. Hidden widget appear at the bottom of your dashboard while you are in edit mode, where you can unhide them.

## Rearrange
You can rearrange the widgets by dragging and dropping them on other widgets, so they take their place.

## Resize
You can resize the widget width and height. The dashboard is aligned as a grid, and you specify the number of *cells* that are occupied by this widget.

## Reset Configuration
You can reset the configuration per widget (to bring it into it's original size), and for the whole dashboard. If you reset the configuration for the whole dashboard, it also applies it to the hidden widgets and their position.
