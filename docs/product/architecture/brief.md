# Architecture Brief — Lighthouse

## Application Architecture

Feature: rbac-enhancements
Wave: DESIGN
Date: 2026-05-10
Architect: Morgan (Solution Architect)
Paradigm: OOP (C# backend), functional-leaning React (hooks, pure components) on the frontend

---

### Architectural Pattern

**Ports-and-Adapters (Hexagonal Architecture)** — already established in the codebase. This feature extends existing ports and adapters; it introduces no new architectural style.

Key invariants upheld:
- `IRbacAdministrationService` is the single inbound port for all RBAC business logic. `AuthorizationController` calls only the interface, never the concrete class.
- `LighthouseDbContext` is the driven adapter for persistence. `RbacAdministrationService` depends on EF Core abstractions, not on raw SQL.
- `useRbac` hook is the single RBAC state source on the frontend. All page and component gating derives from it. No component fetches `/my-summary` independently.
- `PERMISSIVE_SUMMARY` fallback in `useRbac` is an invariant: a failed RBAC call never locks users out. This must not be changed.

---

### System Context and Capabilities

Lighthouse is a software delivery forecasting tool. The RBAC enhancements feature adds:

1. Bootstrap flow: first-time System Admin self-assignment with no config file required.
2. Emergency admin: distinct, non-revocable display in the user table.
3. RBAC Status diagnostic panel: replaces status chips with a collapsible disclosure section.
4. User removal: hard-delete with confirmation; GDPR hygiene.
5. Access tab visibility gating: Access and System Admins tabs rendered only when `isRbacEnabled`.
6. Scoped admin self-service: Settings and Access tabs visible to Team/Portfolio Admins for their own scope.
7. Bug fix (US-08): `ScopedGroupMappingManager` calls the scoped endpoint, not the global endpoint.
8. Write control hiding: all write controls hidden (not disabled) from Viewers.
9. Viewer experience: clean read-only view of Deliveries; no admin controls visible.
10. Create button fix: non-system-admins bypass the connections-required check.
11. E2E test coverage: 7 scenarios across bootstrap, System Admin flow, scoped access, and SSO group equivalence.

### Component Decomposition

All components listed here are EXTEND. No new components are required by this feature; every change is an additive modification to an existing file.

| Component | File | Change Type | Change Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| AuthorizationController | `Lighthouse.Backend/Lighthouse.Backend/API/AuthorizationController.cs` | EXTEND | Add `DELETE /authorization/users/{userProfileId}` (US-04). Add `GET /authorization/teams/{teamId}/group-mappings` scoped read endpoint (US-08). |
| IRbacAdministrationService | `Lighthouse.Backend/Lighthouse.Backend/Services/Interfaces/Authorization/IRbacAdministrationService.cs` | EXTEND | Add `DeleteUserAsync(int userProfileId, CancellationToken)` and `GetTeamGroupMappingsAsync(int teamId, CancellationToken)` method signatures. |
| RbacAdministrationService | `Lighthouse.Backend/Lighthouse.Backend/Services/Implementation/Authorization/RbacAdministrationService.cs` | EXTEND | Implement the two new methods. Emergency admin detection: `isEmergencyAdmin` derived from config subject match. |
| RbacUserSummary | `Lighthouse.Backend/Lighthouse.Backend/Models/Authorization/RbacUserSummary.cs` | EXTEND | Add `IsEmergencyAdmin` boolean property (US-02). |
| UserAuthorizationSummary | `Lighthouse.Backend/Lighthouse.Backend/Models/Authorization/UserAuthorizationSummary.cs` | NO CHANGE | The emergency admin, when logged in, receives `IsSystemAdmin: true` in their `/my-summary`. They are indistinguishable from a normal System Admin from their own perspective — this is intentional. The `IsEmergencyAdmin` flag is only needed in the user list (`RbacUserSummary`) for System Admins managing the table. `UserAuthorizationSummary` does not need this field. |
| RbacModels.ts | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/models/Authorization/RbacModels.ts` | EXTEND | Add `isEmergencyAdmin?: boolean` to `RbacUser` interface (US-02). |
| RbacService.ts | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/services/Api/RbacService.ts` | EXTEND | Add `deleteUser(userProfileId: number): Promise<void>` to `IRbacService` interface and `RbacService` class (US-04). Add `getTeamGroupMappings(teamId: number): Promise<RbacGroupMapping[]>` (US-08). |
| RbacSettings.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/pages/Settings/Rbac/RbacSettings.tsx` | EXTEND | Replace 6 chips with collapsed `<Accordion>` "RBAC Status" panel (US-03). Render `isEmergencyAdmin` state in user table row with lock indicator and no Revoke button (US-02). Add "Remove" button per row (US-04) with `DeleteConfirmationDialog`. |
| ScopedGroupMappingManager.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/components/Common/Authorization/ScopedGroupMappingManager.tsx` | EXTEND (bug fix) | Change the `loadGroupMappings` data fetch from the global endpoint to the scoped endpoint passed as a prop (US-08). Parent components (TeamDetail, PortfolioDetail) already hold the scoped `teamId`/`portfolioId` — they pass the correct fetcher. |
| Settings.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/pages/Settings/Settings.tsx` | EXTEND | Gate the "System Admins" tab (value "50") on `rbac.isRbacEnabled` in the `visibleTabs` filter (US-05). Currently gated on `rbac.isSystemAdmin` only — must additionally check `isRbacEnabled`. Log Level gating handled inside `SystemSettingsTab` (WD-10). |
| SystemSettingsTab.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/pages/Settings/System/SystemSettingsTab.tsx` | EXTEND | Gate Log Level section on `isSystemAdmin` from `useRbac()` (WD-10, US-09). |
| TeamDetail.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/pages/Teams/Detail/TeamDetail.tsx` | EXTEND | Gate Settings and Access tabs: `showSettingsTab` and `showAccessTab` already use `rbac.isTeamAdmin(team.id)` — add `&& rbac.isRbacEnabled` guard for the Access tab (US-05, US-06). Gate CloudSync (Update All), Clone, and Delete controls on `rbac.isTeamAdmin(teamId)` (US-07). Fix `loadTeamGroupMappings` to call the scoped endpoint via `rbacService.getTeamGroupMappings(teamId)` instead of `rbacService.getGroupMappings()` with client-side filter (US-08). Gate QuickSettingsBar on `rbac.isTeamAdmin(teamId)` (US-09). |
| PortfolioDetail.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/pages/Portfolios/Detail/PortfolioDetail.tsx` | EXTEND | Gate Deliveries tab, Settings tab, and Access tab: `showDeliveriesAndSettingsTabs` already uses `rbac.isPortfolioAdmin(portfolio.id)` — add `&& rbac.isRbacEnabled` guard for the Access tab (US-05). Gate CloudSync, Clone, Delete controls on `rbac.isPortfolioAdmin(portfolioId)` (US-07). Fix `loadPortfolioGroupMappings` to call scoped endpoint (US-08). Gate QuickSettingsBar on `rbac.isPortfolioAdmin(portfolioId)` (US-09). For Deliveries tab: gate Add/Edit/Delete delivery actions within `PortfolioDeliveryView` on `isPortfolioAdmin` (US-09, WD-12). |
| PortfolioDeliveryView.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/pages/Portfolios/Detail/PortfolioDeliveryView.tsx` | EXTEND | Accept or derive `canEdit` prop (from `isPortfolioAdmin`). Hide Add/Edit/Delete delivery action controls when `canEdit` is false (US-09, WD-12). |
| OverviewDashboard.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/pages/Overview/OverviewDashboard.tsx` | EXTEND | Hide connections section for non-System-Admins (WD-11, US-09). Gate Add Connection button on `rbac.isSystemAdmin` (already done — verify). Fix "Add Team" disabled logic: `disabled={!canCreateTeam || (rbac.isSystemAdmin && !hasConnections)}` so non-system-admin canCreateTeam users are never blocked by the connections check (US-10). Gate `OnboardingStepper` on `rbac.canCreateTeam || rbac.canCreatePortfolio` (already done via props — verify WD-13). |
| RoleBasedAccessControl.spec.ts | `Lighthouse.EndToEndTests/tests/specs/auth/RoleBasedAccessControl.spec.ts` | EXTEND | Implement all 7 E2E scenarios replacing the scaffold comment. Use `testWithAuth` fixture, `TestConfig` credentials for 4 test users. New Page Object additions as needed. |

---

### Driving Ports (Inbound HTTP Endpoints)

All routes are on `AuthorizationController` at `/api/latest/authorization` and `/api/v1/authorization`.

| Method | Route | Auth Requirement | Purpose | Change |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/authorization/status` | Authenticated | RBAC status for diagnostic panel | Existing |
| GET | `/authorization/my-summary` | Authenticated | User's own authorisation summary (feeds `useRbac`) | Existing |
| POST | `/authorization/bootstrap/system-admin` | Authenticated | Bootstrap first System Admin | Existing |
| GET | `/authorization/users` | CanManageRbac (System Admin) | List all known users | Existing |
| DELETE | `/authorization/users/{userProfileId}` | CanManageRbac (System Admin) | Hard-delete user and all their role assignments | **NEW (US-04)** |
| POST | `/authorization/system-admins/{userProfileId}` | CanManageRbac | Grant System Admin | Existing |
| DELETE | `/authorization/system-admins/{userProfileId}` | CanManageRbac | Revoke System Admin | Existing |
| GET | `/authorization/teams/{teamId}/members` | CanManageTeamMembership | Get team members | Existing |
| PUT | `/authorization/teams/{teamId}/members/{userProfileId}` | CanManageTeamMembership | Upsert team member | Existing |
| DELETE | `/authorization/teams/{teamId}/members/{userProfileId}` | CanManageTeamMembership | Remove team member | Existing |
| GET | `/authorization/teams/{teamId}/group-mappings` | CanManageTeamMembership | Get scoped group mappings for a team | **NEW (US-08)** |
| GET | `/authorization/portfolios/{portfolioId}/members` | CanManagePortfolioMembership | Get portfolio members | Existing |
| PUT | `/authorization/portfolios/{portfolioId}/members/{userProfileId}` | CanManagePortfolioMembership | Upsert portfolio member | Existing |
| DELETE | `/authorization/portfolios/{portfolioId}/members/{userProfileId}` | CanManagePortfolioMembership | Remove portfolio member | Existing |
| GET | `/authorization/group-mappings` | CanManageRbac (System Admin) | Get all group mappings (global) | Existing |
| POST | `/authorization/group-mappings` | CanManageRbac | Create group mapping | Existing |
| DELETE | `/authorization/group-mappings/{mappingId}` | CanManageRbac | Remove group mapping | Existing |

Note: A portfolio-scoped `GET /authorization/portfolios/{portfolioId}/group-mappings` endpoint should also be added symmetrically with the team-scoped one (WD-08 applies equally to portfolios, enforced by `CanManagePortfolioMembership`).

### Driven Ports (Outbound)

| Port | Adapter | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| RBAC persistence port (implicit in `RbacAdministrationService`) | `LighthouseDbContext` | EF Core 8, SQLite/PostgreSQL | Reads/writes `UserPermission`, `RbacGroupMapping`, `UserProfile` entities |
| OIDC token introspection port (implicit in ASP.NET Core auth middleware) | ASP.NET Core OIDC middleware | Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect | Validates JWT, extracts `sub` claim and group claims for role elevation |

Both driven ports are existing adapters. This feature extends their usage but introduces no new driven port implementations.

---

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Version | License | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Backend framework | ASP.NET Core Web API | .NET 8 | MIT (open source) | Established in codebase; no change |
| Backend ORM | Entity Framework Core | 8.x | MIT | Established in codebase; no change |
| Backend test database | SQLite in-memory | — | Public Domain | Fast isolation per test; existing pattern |
| Frontend framework | React | 18 | MIT | Established in codebase |
| Frontend language | TypeScript | 5.x | Apache 2.0 | Established in codebase |
| Frontend UI library | Material UI (MUI) | 5.x | MIT | Established in codebase; `Accordion` used for status panel (US-03) |
| Frontend routing | React Router | 6.x | MIT | Established in codebase |
| E2E test framework | Playwright | 1.x | Apache 2.0 | Established in codebase; `testWithAuth` fixture reused |
| OIDC provider (test) | Keycloak | — | Apache 2.0 | Established in test environment |

No new technologies are introduced by this feature. All choices reuse the existing stack.

---

### Reuse Analysis

For every component modified, the decision to EXTEND (not CREATE NEW) is justified below.

| Existing Component | File | Overlap | Decision | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AuthorizationController | `Lighthouse.Backend/Lighthouse.Backend/API/AuthorizationController.cs` | CRUD for all RBAC resources | EXTEND | Existing controller handles all /authorization/* routes. Adding 2 endpoints (DELETE users/{id}, GET teams/{teamId}/group-mappings) follows the established pattern. No new controller needed. |
| IRbacAdministrationService | `Lighthouse.Backend/Lighthouse.Backend/Services/Interfaces/Authorization/IRbacAdministrationService.cs` | RBAC business logic port | EXTEND | 2 new method signatures added to the existing interface. No new port needed; the existing port is the correct abstraction boundary. |
| RbacAdministrationService | `Lighthouse.Backend/Lighthouse.Backend/Services/Implementation/Authorization/RbacAdministrationService.cs` | Full RBAC business logic | EXTEND | Implements the 2 new interface methods. Emergency admin detection belongs here (config-sourced subject match). |
| RbacUserSummary | `Lighthouse.Backend/Lighthouse.Backend/Models/Authorization/RbacUserSummary.cs` | User data model for RBAC user list | EXTEND | Add `IsEmergencyAdmin bool`. No new model: existing record captures all user-level RBAC data. |
| RbacModels.ts | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/models/Authorization/RbacModels.ts` | TypeScript RBAC types | EXTEND | Add `isEmergencyAdmin?: boolean` to `RbacUser`. No new type file. |
| RbacService.ts | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/services/Api/RbacService.ts` | HTTP adapter for /authorization/* | EXTEND | Add 2 methods to existing interface and class. Keeps all RBAC HTTP calls in one adapter. |
| RbacSettings.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/pages/Settings/Rbac/RbacSettings.tsx` | System Admin management UI | EXTEND | Replace chips with Accordion status panel, add emergency admin display, add user removal. All within the same bounded component. |
| ScopedGroupMappingManager.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/components/Common/Authorization/ScopedGroupMappingManager.tsx` | Group mapping UI | EXTEND (bug fix) | Fix API call from global to scoped endpoint. The component's interface and responsibilities are unchanged; only the data source is corrected. |
| Settings.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/pages/Settings/Settings.tsx` | Settings page tab orchestrator | EXTEND | Add `isRbacEnabled` guard to the System Admins tab filter. Minimal, isolated change. |
| SystemSettingsTab.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/pages/Settings/System/SystemSettingsTab.tsx` | Configuration settings tab | EXTEND | Gate Log Level section on `isSystemAdmin`. Single conditional render addition. |
| TeamDetail.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/pages/Teams/Detail/TeamDetail.tsx` | Team detail page | EXTEND | Settings tab: gated on `isTeamAdmin(teamId)` only — no `isRbacEnabled` guard (settings tab predates RBAC and is a general team administration concern). Access tab: gated on `isRbacEnabled AND isTeamAdmin(teamId)` — both conditions must be true (US-05, US-06). Gate write controls (Update All, Clone, Delete, QuickSettingsBar) on `isTeamAdmin(teamId)` (US-07). Fix `loadTeamGroupMappings` to call the scoped endpoint (US-08). |
| PortfolioDetail.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/pages/Portfolios/Detail/PortfolioDetail.tsx` | Portfolio detail page | EXTEND | Settings tab: gated on `isPortfolioAdmin(portfolioId)` only. Deliveries tab: gated on `isPortfolioAdmin(portfolioId)` (unchanged — `showDeliveriesAndSettingsTabs`). Access tab: gated on `isRbacEnabled AND isPortfolioAdmin(portfolioId)`. Gate write controls on `isPortfolioAdmin(portfolioId)` (US-07). Fix `loadPortfolioGroupMappings` to call scoped endpoint (US-08). |
| PortfolioDeliveryView.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/pages/Portfolios/Detail/PortfolioDeliveryView.tsx` | Portfolio deliveries view | EXTEND | Gate Add/Edit/Delete delivery controls on admin rights. Deliveries tab remains visible to Viewers (WD-12). |
| OverviewDashboard.tsx | `Lighthouse.Frontend/src/pages/Overview/OverviewDashboard.tsx` | Overview dashboard | EXTEND | Hide connections section for non-admins, fix Add Team/Portfolio disabled logic for non-system-admin canCreate users. |
| RoleBasedAccessControl.spec.ts | `Lighthouse.EndToEndTests/tests/specs/auth/RoleBasedAccessControl.spec.ts` | RBAC E2E spec | EXTEND | Implement all 7 scenarios. Scaffold file exists with zero tests; this is a pure implementation task. |

### Integration Patterns

**Frontend → Backend**: All communication is synchronous REST over HTTPS. The `useRbac` hook fetches `/authorization/my-summary` once on component mount and re-fetches after any role mutation. No polling; no WebSocket; no event streaming for RBAC state.

**OIDC group claim processing**: The OIDC middleware extracts the `groups` claim (claim name configurable via `RbacStatus.groupClaimName`). `RbacAdministrationService` evaluates group-to-role mappings stored in `RbacGroupMapping` during each `GetAuthorizationSummaryAsync` call. This is a read-time resolution, not a sync/import.

**Permissive fallback**: If `/authorization/my-summary` fails (network error, 5xx), `useRbac` falls back to `PERMISSIVE_SUMMARY` (`isRbacEnabled: false`, `isSystemAdmin: true`). This ensures users are never locked out by RBAC infrastructure failures.

**No new integration points** are introduced by this feature. All communication paths exist already.

---

### Quality Attribute Strategies

**Correctness**: The single RBAC state source (`useRbac` hook) and the permissive fallback invariant together ensure that all gating decisions are consistent. No component owns its own RBAC fetch. E2E scenario 7 (group-based rights = individual rights) is the regression gate for correctness of the permission model.

**Maintainability**: Adding a new guarded control requires touching only two files: the component that renders it (add the `useRbac()` conditional) and, if a new permission check is needed, `useRbac.ts`. The `IRbacAdministrationService` interface is the single boundary for backend RBAC changes.

**Testability**: Backend: `IRbacAdministrationService` as a port enables full mock isolation in unit tests. Frontend: `useRbac` is a pure React hook; component gating is testable by passing different hook return values. E2E: 4 dedicated test users in Keycloak cover all permission combinations.

**RBAC-disabled regression safety**: All gating conditions are behind `isRbacEnabled`. When `isRbacEnabled === false`, all `isSystemAdmin` / `isTeamAdmin` / `isPortfolioAdmin` calls return `true` (PERMISSIVE_SUMMARY). The app behaves identically to its pre-RBAC state.

---

### Deployment Architecture

No infrastructure changes. The feature is a combination of:
- Backend code changes (C# — build and deploy with existing pipeline)
- Frontend code changes (TypeScript/React — build with existing Vite pipeline)
- E2E test additions (Playwright — run in existing CI stage)

The test environment requires 4 dedicated Keycloak users with configurable group memberships. This is a test-environment configuration item, not a production code change.

### Architectural Enforcement

Language-appropriate enforcement tooling for the architectural rules in this feature:

| Rule | Enforcement Mechanism |
|---|---|
| All RBAC gating must derive from `useRbac()` — no component fetches `/my-summary` directly | ESLint custom rule or import-linter contract: components in `/pages/` and `/components/` must not import `RbacService` directly; only `useRbac` is permitted as the entry point |
| `IRbacAdministrationService` is the only inbound dependency for `AuthorizationController` | ArchUnitNET test: `AuthorizationController` must not directly reference `RbacAdministrationService` (the concrete class) |
| Driven adapters depend inward: `RbacAdministrationService` must not depend on controllers | ArchUnitNET test: classes in `Services.Implementation` must not reference classes in `API` |

## Application Architecture — work-tracking-oauth-authentication (DESIGN delta)

Feature: work-tracking-oauth-authentication
Wave: DESIGN
Date: 2026-05-14
Architect: Morgan (Solution Architect)

This section is **additive** to the rbac-enhancements baseline above. The architectural pattern (ports-and-adapters), paradigm (OOP backend + functional-leaning React), and core invariants are unchanged. The OAuth feature plugs into two established extension points: `AuthenticationMethodSchema` (auth-method registry) and `WorkTrackingSystemConnectionOption` (encrypted per-option storage).

### Key invariants introduced

- **`IRbacAdministrationService` is the single inbound port for RBAC business logic** — unchanged; OAuth uses `[RbacGuard(SystemAdmin)]` and `[LicenseGuard(RequirePremium = true)]` at the controller-action boundary. No new authorisation rules.
- **`IOAuthService` is the single inbound port for the OAuth flow**. `OAuthController` and `OAuthBearerAuthStrategy` both depend on this interface, never on `OAuthService` (the concrete class).
- **`IOAuthProvider` is the single outbound port for IdP-specific OAuth knowledge.** Resolved via `IOAuthProviderRegistry` keyed on `AuthenticationMethodKey` (a string). Adding a third provider requires zero changes to `OAuthController`, `OAuthService`, `OAuthCredential`, or the registry. See ADR-007.
- **`OAuthCredential` is the only new entity.** Static configuration (`clientId`, `clientSecret`) reuses the existing `WorkTrackingSystemConnectionOption` pattern with `IsSecret = true`. See ADR-008.
- **`Lighthouse:BaseUrl` is the sole source of truth for the OAuth callback URL display.** Not derived from `Request.Host`. See ADR-009.
- **Refresh is pre-request, single-flight, in-process** via a `ConcurrentDictionary<int, SemaphoreSlim>` keyed on `OAuthCredential.Id`. See ADR-010.

### New driving ports (HTTP)

| Method | Route | Auth Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/oauth/{providerKey}/connect` | `[Authorize]` + `[RbacGuard(SystemAdmin)]` + `[LicenseGuard(RequirePremium = true)]` |
| GET | `/api/oauth/callback` | `[AllowAnonymous]` (state-token CSRF) |
| POST | `/api/oauth/{providerKey}/disconnect` | `[Authorize]` + `[RbacGuard(SystemAdmin)]` + `[LicenseGuard(RequirePremium = true)]` |

### New driven ports

| Port | Adapter | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `IOAuthProvider` | `JiraOAuthProvider`, `AdoOAuthProvider` | Per-IdP OAuth dance (auth URL, code exchange, refresh) |
| `IOAuthStateTokenIssuer` | `OAuthStateTokenIssuer` | HMAC-signed CSRF token (no session store) |
| `IWorkTrackingAuthStrategy` | `PatAuthStrategy`, `JiraCloudBasicAuthStrategy`, `OAuthBearerAuthStrategy` | Per-connection outbound auth-header construction |

### Reused (no new adapter introduced)

- `ICryptoService` — encrypts `clientSecret`, `AccessToken`, `RefreshToken` at rest.
- `LicenseGuardAttribute` + `LicenseService` — premium gate enforcement.
- `LighthouseAppContext` — extended with one `DbSet<OAuthCredential>`, FK with cascade delete.
- `AuthenticationMethodSchema` — extended with `jira.oauth` and `ado.oauth` entries (premium-flagged).
- Existing FE standalone-vs-server runtime flag (used by US-04 standalone-mode guard).

### ADR References (this feature)

- [ADR-007](./adr-007-oauth-provider-registry.md): OAuth Provider Registry — String Key, DI-Resolved
- [ADR-008](./adr-008-oauth-credential-separation.md): OAuth Credential Storage — Separate Entity, Configuration Reuses Options
- [ADR-009](./adr-009-oauth-baseurl-callback.md): OAuth Callback URL Derived From a Server-Configured BaseUrl
- [ADR-010](./adr-010-oauth-single-flight-refresh.md): OAuth Token Refresh — Pre-Request, Single-Flight, In-Process

### Architectural Enforcement (this feature)

| Rule | Enforcement Mechanism |
|---|---|
| `OAuthController` depends only on `IOAuthService` (never `OAuthService` concrete) | ArchUnitNET test (extend existing suite) |
| `IOAuthProvider` implementations are registered in DI with unique `ProviderKey` strings matching `AuthenticationMethodKeys` constants | Startup self-check in `Program.cs` iterates `AuthenticationMethodSchema` and asserts every `*.oauth` key has a matching `IOAuthProvider`; app fails fast at boot on mismatch |
| Outbound IdP HTTP calls only via `IOAuthProvider` implementations — connectors never call IdPs directly | ArchUnitNET test: classes outside `Services.Implementation.OAuth.Providers` must not import `auth.atlassian.com` / `login.microsoftonline.com` URL constants |
| `OAuthCredential.AccessToken` / `RefreshToken` columns are stored encrypted | EF value-converter configured in `LighthouseAppContext`; integration test asserts encrypted bytes on disk differ from cleartext |
