# Unified Memory Contract

Using Flowbaby tools (`flowbabyStoreSummary` and `flowbabyRetrieveMemory`) is **mandatory**.

---

## Core Principle

Memory is not a formality—it is part of your reasoning. Treat retrieval like asking a colleague who has perfect recall of this workspace. Treat storage like leaving a note for your future self who has total amnesia.

**The cost/benefit rule:** Retrieval is cheap (sub-second, a few hundred tokens). Proceeding without context when it exists is expensive (wrong answers, repeated mistakes, user frustration). When in doubt, retrieve.

---

## When to Retrieve

Retrieve at **decision points**, not just at turn start. In a typical multi-step task, expect 2–5 retrievals.

**Retrieve when you:**

- Are about to make an assumption → check if it was already decided
- Don't recognize a term, file, or pattern → check if it was discussed
- Are choosing between options → check if one was tried or rejected
- Feel uncertain ("I think...", "Probably...") → that's a retrieval signal
- Are about to do work → check if similar work already exists
- Hit a constraint or error you don't understand → check for prior context

**If no results:** Broaden to concept-level and retry once. If still empty, proceed and note the gap.

---

## How to Query

Queries should be **specific and hypothesis-driven**, not vague or encyclopedic.

| ❌ Weak query | ✅ Strong query |
|---------------|-----------------|
| "What do I know about this project?" | "Previous decisions about authentication strategy in this repo" |
| "Any relevant memory?" | "Did we try Redis for caching? What happened?" |
| "User preferences" | "User's stated preferences for error handling verbosity" |
| "Past work" | "Implementation status of webhook retry logic" |

**Heuristic:** State the *question you're trying to answer*, not the *category of information* you want.

---

## When to Store

Store at **value boundaries**—when you've created something worth preserving. Ask: "Would I be frustrated to lose this context?"

**Store when you:**

- Complete a non-trivial task or subtask
- Make a decision that narrows future options
- Discover a constraint, dead end, or "gotcha"
- Learn a user preference or workspace convention
- Reach a natural pause (topic switch, waiting for user)
- Have done meaningful work, even if incomplete

**Do not store:**

- Trivial acknowledgments or yes/no exchanges
- Duplicate information already in memory
- Raw outputs without reasoning (store the *why*, not just the *what*)

**Fallback minimum:** If you haven't stored in 5 turns, store now regardless.

**Always end storage with:** "Saved progress to Flowbaby memory."

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it's harmful |
|--------------|------------------|
| Retrieve once at turn start, never again | Misses context that becomes relevant mid-task |
| Store only at conversation end | Loses intermediate reasoning; if session crashes, everything is gone |
| Generic queries ("What should I know?") | Returns noise; specificity gets signal |
| Skip retrieval to "save time" | False economy—retrieval is fast; redoing work is slow |
| Store every turn mechanically | Pollutes memory with low-value entries |
| Treat memory as write-only | If you never retrieve, you're journaling, not learning |

---

## Commitments

1. **Retrieve before reasoning.** Don't generate options, make recommendations, or start implementation without checking for prior context.
2. **Retrieve when uncertain.** Hedging language ("I think", "Probably", "Unless") is a retrieval trigger.
3. **Store at value boundaries.** Decisions, findings, constraints, progress—store before moving on.
4. **Acknowledge memory.** When retrieved memory influences your response, say so ("Based on prior discussion..." or "Memory indicates...").
5. **Fail loudly.** If memory tools fail, announce no-memory mode immediately.
6. **Prefer the user.** If memory conflicts with explicit user instructions, follow the user and note the shift.

---

## No-Memory Fallback

If `flowbabyRetrieveMemory` or `flowbabyStoreSummary` calls fail or are rejected:

1. **Announce immediately:** "Flowbaby memory is unavailable; operating in no-memory mode."
2. **Compensate:** Record decisions in output documents with extra detail.
3. **Remind at end:** "Memory was unavailable. Consider initializing Flowbaby for cross-session continuity."

### Retrieval

```json
#flowbabyRetrieveMemory {
  "query": "Specific question or hypothesis about prior context",
  "maxResults": 3
}
```

### Storage

```json
#flowbabyStoreSummary {
  "topic": "3–7 word title",
  "context": "300–1500 chars: what happened, why, constraints, dead ends",
  "decisions": ["Decision 1", "Decision 2"],
  "rationale": ["Why decision 1", "Why decision 2"],
  "metadata": {"status": "Active"}
}
```
