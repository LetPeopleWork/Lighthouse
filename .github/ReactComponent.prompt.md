# React Component Implementation

Your goal is to help me implement or modify a React component for the Lighthouse application.

## Component Requirements
- Use TypeScript with proper typing
- Follow functional component patterns with hooks
- Use double quotes for strings and tabs for indentation
- For forms, use the react-hook-form library with uncontrolled components
- Follow Material UI design patterns when applicable
- Include JSDoc comments for component props

## Testing Requirements
- Create a matching `.test.tsx` file next to the component
- Use React Testing Library with Vitest for tests
- Mock API services and dependencies
- Test all major component interactions and states

## Folder Structure
Follow the existing folder structure:
- Components should be organized by feature area
- Shared components belong in the common components directory
- Include an index.ts file for clean exports

## Integration Requirements
- Use the ApiServiceContext for API calls
- Follow unidirectional data flow principles
- Provide proper error handling
- Use proper TypeScript typing for all props and state

Ask for any additional context you need about the component's purpose, styling requirements, or integration points.
